## Libraries used

- **`react-router-dom`:** Handles routing within the application.
- **`react-window`:** Efficiently virtualizes lists to render only on-screen content, optimizing performance.
- **`tailwindcss`:** Provides a utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **`clsx` and `tailwind-merge`:** Utilized for managing and merging CSS classes.
- **`typescript`**

In optimizing the user experience, tabs were chosen for grouping instead of an accordion-style list, particularly beneficial for handling a large amount of data. Additionally, tooltips were strategically added to enhance the user interface where needed.
